 * ascs top header file.
 *
 * license: http://think-async.com/ (the current is www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)
 *
 * Known issues:
 * 1. since 1.1.0, concurrentqueue is not a FIFO queue (it is by design), navigate to the following links for more deatils:
 *  https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue/issues/6
 *  https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue/issues/52
 *  if you're using concurrentqueue, please play attention, this is by design.
 * 2. since 1.1.5 until 1.2, heartbeat function cannot work properly between windows (at least win-10) and Ubuntu (at least Ubuntu-16.04).
 * 3. since 1.1.5 until 1.2, UDP doesn't support heartbeat because UDP doesn't support OOB data.
 * 4. since 1.1.5 until 1.2, SSL doesn't support heartbeat because SSL doesn't support OOB data.
 *
 * 2016.9.25	version 1.0.0
 * Based on st_asio_wrapper 1.2.0.
 * Directory structure refactoring.
 * Classes renaming, remove 'st_', 'tcp_' and 'udp_' prefix.
 * File renaming, remove 'st_asio_wrapper_' prefix.
 * Distinguish TCP and UDP related classes and files by tcp/udp namespace and tcp/udp directory.
 * Need c++14, if your compiler detected duplicated 'shared_mutex' definition, please define ASCS_HAS_STD_SHARED_MUTEX macro.
 * Need to define ASIO_STANDALONE and ASIO_HAS_STD_CHRONO macros.
 *
 * 2016.10.8	version 1.1.0
 * Support concurrent queue (https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue), it's lock-free.
 * Define ASCS_USE_CONCURRENT_QUEUE macro to use your personal message queue.
 * Define ASCS_USE_CONCURRE macro to use concurrent queue, otherwise ascs::list will be used as the message queue.
 * Drop original congestion control (because it cannot totally resolve dead loop) and add a semi-automatic congestion control.
 * Demonstrate how to use the new semi-automatic congestion control (echo_server, echo_client, pingpong_server and pingpong_client).
 * Drop post_msg_buffer and corresponding functions (like post_msg()) and timer (ascs::socket::TIMER_HANDLE_POST_BUFFER).
 * Optimize locks on message sending and dispatching.
 * Add enum shutdown_states.
 * Rename class ascs::std_list to ascs::list.
 * ascs::timer now can be used independently.
 * Add a new type ascs::timer::tid to represent timer ID.
 * Add a new packer--fixed_length_packer.
 * Add a new class--message_queue.
 *
 * 2016.10.16	version 1.1.1
 * Support non-lock queue, it's totally not thread safe and lock-free, it can improve IO throughput with particular business.
 * Demonstrate how and when to use non-lock queue as the input and output message buffer.
 * Queues (and their internal containers) used as input and output message buffer are now configurable (by macros or template arguments).
 * New macros--ASCS_INPUT_QUEUE, ASCS_INPUT_CONTAINER, ASCS_OUTPUT_QUEUE and ASCS_OUTPUT_CONTAINER.
 * Drop macro ASCS_USE_CONCURRENT_QUEUE, rename macro ASCS_USE_CONCURRE to ASCS_HAS_CONCURRENT_QUEUE.
 * In contrast to non_lock_queue, split message_queue into lock_queue and lock_free_queue.
 * Move container related classes and functions from base.h to container.h.
 * Improve efficiency in scenarios of low throughput like pingpong test.
 * Replaceable packer/unpacker now support replaceable_buffer (an alias of auto_buffer) and shared_buffer to be their message type.
 * Move class statistic and obj_with_begin_time out of ascs::socket to reduce template tiers.
 *
 * 2016.11.1	version 1.1.2
 * Fix bug: ascs::list cannot be moved properly via moving constructor.
 * Use ASCS_DELAY_CLOSE instead of ASCS_ENHANCED_STABILITY macro to control delay close duration,
 *  0 is an equivalent of defining ASCS_ENHANCED_STABILITY, other values keep the same meanings as before.
 * Move ascs::socket::closing related logic to ascs::object.
 * Make ascs::socket::id(uint_fast64_t) private to avoid changing IDs by users.
 * Call close at the end of shutdown function, just for safety.
 * Add move capture in lambda.
 * Optimize lambda expressions.
 *
 * 2016.11.13	version 1.1.3
 * Introduce lock-free mechanism for some appropriate logics (many requesters, only one can succeed, others will fail rather than wait).
 * Remove all mutex (except mutex in object_pool, service_pump, lock_queue and udp::socket).
 * Sharply simplified timer class.
 *
 * 2016.12.6	version 1.1.4
 * Drop unnecessary macro definition (ASIO_HAS_STD_CHRONO).
 * Simplify header files' dependence.
 * Add Visual C++ solution and project files (Visual C++ 14.0).
 * Monitor time consumptions for message packing and unpacking.
 * Fix bug: pop_first_pending_send_msg and pop_first_pending_recv_msg cannot work.
 *
 * 2017.1.1		version 1.1.5
 * Support heartbeat (via OOB data), see ASCS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL macro for more details.
 * Support scatter-gather buffers when receiving messages, this feature needs modification of i_unpacker, you must explicitly define
 *  ASCS_SCATTERED_RECV_BUFFER macro to open it, this is just for compatibility.
 * Simplify lock-free mechanism and use std::atomic_flag instead of std::atomic_size_t.
 * Optimize container insertion (use series of emplace functions instead).
 * Demo echo_client support alterable number of sending thread (before, it's a hard code 16).
 * Fix bug: In extreme cases, messages may get starved in receive buffer and will not be dispatched until arrival of next message.
 * Fix bug: In extreme cases, messages may get starved in send buffer and will not be sent until arrival of next message.
 * Fix bug: Sometimes, connector_base cannot reconnect to the server after link broken.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.5.30	version 1.2.0
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Virtual function reset_state in i_packer and i_unpacker have been renamed to reset.
 * Virtual function is_send_allowed has been renamed to is_ready, it also means ready to receive messages
 *  since message sending is not suspendable any more.
 * Virtual function on_msg_handle has been changed, the link_down variable will not be presented any more.
 * Interface i_server::del_client has been renamed to i_server::del_socket.
 * Function inner_packer and inner_unpacker have been renamed to packer and unpacker.
 * All add_client functions have been renamed to add_socket.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support object restoration (on server side), see macro ASCS_RESTORE_OBJECT for more details.
 * Re-implement heartbeat function, use user data (so need packer and unpacker's support) instead of OOB, now there will be no any
 *  limitations for using heartbeat.
 * Refactor and optimize ssl objects, now ssl::connector_base and ssl::server_socket_base are reusable,
 *  just need you to define macro ASCS_REUSE_SSL_STREAM.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Before on_close() to be called, socket::start becomes available (so user can call it falsely).
 * If a timer failed or stopped by callback, its status not set properly (should be set to TIMER_CANCELED).
 * Make ssl shutting down thread safe.
 * Make reconnecting after all async invocations (like object reusing or restoration).
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Virtual function i_packer::pack_heartbeat been introduced to support heartbeat function.
 * Interface i_server::restore_socket been added, see macro ASCS_RESTORE_OBJECT for more details.
 * Be able to manually start heartbeat function without defining macro ASCS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL, see demo echo_server for more details.
 * Support sync mode when sending messages, it's also a type of congestion control like safe_send_msg.
 * Expand enum tcp::socket::shutdown_states, now it's able to represent all SOCKET status (connected, shutting down and broken),
 *  so rename it to link_status.
 * Enhance class timer (function is_timer and another stop_all_timer been added).
 * Support all buffer types that asio supported when receiving messages, use macro ASCS_RECV_BUFFER_TYPE (it's the only way) to define the buffer type,
 *  it's effective for both TCP and UDP.
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Drop ASCS_HAS_STD_SHARED_MUTEX macro.
 * Drop ASCS_DISCARD_MSG_WHEN_LINK_DOWN macro and related logic, because it brings complexity and race condition,
 *  and are not very useful.
 * Drop socket::is_closable, tcp::connector_base will overwrite socket::on_close to implement reconnecting mechanism.
 * Not support pausing message sending and dispatching any more, because they bring complexity and race condition,
 *  and are not very useful.
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move heartbeat function from connector_base and server_socket_base to socket, so introduce new virtual function
 *  virtual void on_heartbeat_error() to socket, subclass need to implement it.
 * Move async shutdown function from connector_base and server_socket_base to socket, so introduce new virtual function
 *  virtual void on_async_shutdown_error() to socket, subclass need to implement it.
 * Move handshake from ssl::server_base to ssl::server_socket_base.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Use std::mutex instead of std::shared_mutex (the former is more efficient in ascs' usage scenario), thus c++11 is enough for ascs.
 * Move macro ASCS_SCATTERED_RECV_BUFFER from ascs to ascs::ext, because it doesn't belong to ascs any more after introduced macro ASCS_RECV_BUFFER_TYPE.
 * Move directory include/ascs/ssl into directory include/ascs/tcp/, because ssl is based on ascs::tcp.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.6.19	version 1.2.1
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix race condition on member variable last_send_msg in tcp::socket_base.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Optimize reconnecting mechanism.
 * Enhance class timer.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Rename connector_base and ssl::connector_base to client_socket_base and ssl::client_socket_base, the former is still available, but is just an alias.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.7.9		version 1.2.2
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * No error_code will be presented anymore when call io_service::run, suggest to define macro ASCS_ENHANCED_STABILITY.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Add two demos for concurrent test.
 * Support unstripped message (take the default unpacker for example, it will not strip message header in parse_msg), this feature is disabled by default,
 *  you can call i_unpacker's void stripped(bool) function to enable it.
 *  udp::i_unpacker doesn't have this feature, it always and only support unstripped message.
 *
 * FIX:
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Truly support asio 1.11 (don't use deprecated functions and classes any more), and of course, asio 1.10 will be supported too.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Use mutable_buffer and const_buffer instead of mutable_buffers_1 and const_buffers_1 if possible, this can gain some performance improvement.
 * Call force_shutdown instead of graceful_shutdown in tcp::client_base::uninit().
